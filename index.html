                  <p>Passion is what drives my drives my journey in Art. At the age of 5, I started learning painting from one of the finest art teachers in my home city. Since then, there is nothing that has stopped me from appreciating the beauty of art. I have tried my hands at various different mediums throughout all these years. My paintbrush for me is like a magic wandâ€¦ creating spells and artwork with every stroke on the paper. I have always found it easier to express myself through paintings or art forms that actually depict my real feelings. 
                      I am one of the 65 students from all across India who have the prestigious national Scholarship in Painting to their name. This was awarded by Centre for Cultural Resource and Training, New Delhi {Government of India}
